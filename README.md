# Harvard CS50 Web Programming with Python and Javascript class project I (2018)

**In 2018 I took a Harvard Univeristy online course on Python web programming in order
to expedite the learning process for Python web progrmmaing, specifically to get real world
examples on the entire lifecycle of Flask and Django projects.** 

**The site listed below was one of the class projects and is a Python Flask based application.
I focused more on the back-end Python side of things rather than a flashy front-end when creating
the site, so the visuals are not stunning by any means. That aside, the site is fully functional and
contains user registration, account creation, search capablitlies, and a functional api. All data is 
stored in a postgresql database.**
